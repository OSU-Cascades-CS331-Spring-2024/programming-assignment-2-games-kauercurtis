	a. The result was I lost everygame
	b. I noticed that it kept going towards the corners and which corners depended on the depth. In the shallower depths, it went towards NW while at 5 it went more NE.
	c. Average time was pretty quick. I think this is because of the board being 4 X 4. Because when I tested it earlier on 8X8 it ran a little slower. 
	This is probably because it has to traverse more paths since the tree is bigger.

	The 5 depth game ended with me not being able to make anymore moves as the agent slowly crept around whatever x's I had on the board.
	The 2 depth game lasted a while. This is because of the limited depth it can traverse to make a decision causing slower gameplay.
	
	The Minimax player's movements were slowed as the depth got shallower I think this is because of the limited possible it can take thus not getting the greater reward if it was able to traverse deeper.
	
	Per move was slower than the 4X4. I believe this is because of the increase of the board size.
